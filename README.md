# 90 in 90

This is a simple app I made to track AA Meetings when I first stopped drinking. I needed to learn how to use Room for work so I went ahead and built this as it was a simpler use of Room than the app I needed to build for work.

I'm not planning on updating this app any time soon (the current version isn't published on Google Play).
